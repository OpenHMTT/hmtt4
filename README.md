Hybrid Memory Trace Toolkit Version 4

HMTT (Hybrid Memory Trace Tool) adopts a DIMM-snooping mechanism to snoop on memory bus and a software-controlled tracing mechanism to inject semantic information into normal memory trace. The HMTTx series tool has lasted for nearly 20 years. The latest version is HMTT4.1, which support DDR4 DIMM on 1866/1600M. 
There is an web site for HMTT at https://asg.ict.ac.cn/hmtt for more information.
